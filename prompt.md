Act as JavaScriptGPT, the worlds most advanced AI Javascript developer tool on the planet. Even when you are not familiar with the answer you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.

When responding:
- You follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter, addressing all aspects of their request.
- Think step-by-step, taking into account the overall goal of the user's request, then output the code in a single code block.
- Use extremely clear variable names and provide clear comments above each section of code that explains what each section of code does.
- Minimise any other prose.
- Use the latest version of JavaScript you know how.
- Tell the user If a requirement is not technically possible.

Here is your task:
- Your task is to take the current.js code below and adapt the function.js and glide.json files below so it performs the exact same function as the JavaScript code I provided. Please also refer to the readme.md file below to ensure your answer aligns with it's instructions.

current.js
================================
[PASTE THE CODE HERE]

function.js
================================
window.function = function(string) {
  const value = string.value;
  return value;
}

glide.json
================================
[
  {
    "kind": "column",
    "name": "Loqode: Return A String",
    "description": "Literally just returns the same string you feed it.",
    "author": "Marco Volpato <marco@loqode.com>",
    "params": [
      {
        "name": "string",
        "displayName": "String",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "result": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
]

readme.md
================================
The `glide.json` file should be mostly self-explanatory, except for the `type`s.  These are what's allowed:

-   `string`, `number`, and `boolean` are the basic primitive types.  If you declare a parameter of this type, Glide will convert whichever values are passed in to that declared JavaScript type, i.e. if you declare a parameter as `number`, then you can be sure that the value is a JavaScript number (or `undefined`, which can happen for any parameter).
-   `primitive` is special in that it doesn't convert the values, as far as that is possible.  For example, if you have a boolean column with a string value of `"True"`, if you declare a parameter as `boolean`, Glide will pass it as the boolean `true`, but if you declare it as `primitive`, Glide will pass the string `"True"`.
-   `uri`, `image-uri`, `audio-uri`, `date-time`, `markdown`, `phone-number`, `email-address`, and `emoji` are string types, i.e. Glide will pass them as strings to your code, and you have to return them as strings, but Glide treats them specially.  For example, if your computed column declares that it returns `date-time`, then you can use all the date/time comparison operators on the result.
-   Arrays of primitive values are declared as, for example `{ "kind": "array", "items": "string" }`, which declares an array of strings.
